# Scaffold

Scaffold bootstrap with bower & NPM. 

To set up: 

//update dependancies to newer versions:
~npm install npm-check-updates -g
~npm-check-updates -u

To run: 

$gulp 

This will run a server with broswersync, change files in the src directory and they will be built in the build directory.
